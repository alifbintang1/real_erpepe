# RES-SAT Solver

This project implements the RES‑SAT algorithm in Python. The RES‑SAT algorithm takes a CNF formula (given as a set of clauses) that is known to be satisfiable and produces a satisfying interpretation using resolution.


## How to Run

1. **Parsing and Solving a CNF instance**

   From the project root, run:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py examples/aim-50-1_6-yes1-4.cnf
